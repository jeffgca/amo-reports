# AMO-Reports

TL;DR: currenntly, some scripts that create csv files ready to import into google docs to display AMO data not captured by fligtar's [panorama](https://github.com/canuckistani/panorama).

Needed stats:

* number of add-ons created / updated on a given day broken down by: all, sdk-based, builder only.
** collect number for (n)
** day runner
** (x) days runner

* some measure of add-on author, ie add-on dev engagement levels.
